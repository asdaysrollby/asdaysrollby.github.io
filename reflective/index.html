<question>What changes in thought patterns did you notice in yourself in the process of going through the activity?</question><br><br>As the activity ensued, I started taking note of significant events that happened during the day. While one can say that I did this just so I can have something to write about in the journal, it actually helped me appreciate those events and make me thankful for going through those. In relation to this, I also started to see the significance of what some people would find to be the most mundane activities I would do. I realized that it’s those acts that I used to not think about much that are actually helping me to get through times like this that are difficult to hold on to because the days seem to rarely ever change. It also helped because I thought that I always have to do something extraordinary when I’m free, and me seeing how these monotonous acts are helping me to get through all of this takes some pressure off in trying to be “productive” during my spare time. <br><br>

<question>In what ways did the activity affect your emotions?</question><br><br>Every moment of happiness became more immensely felt when I started writing entries for this activity, especially with the ones I share with my loved ones. The fact that I was starting to become more aware of these things made me cherish and treasure them even more, especially after the stress and anguish that haunted me during the past semester. Furthermore, I felt a bigger sense of accomplishment whenever I finish something I’d thought to be a daunting task, like being able to stay away from a social media site for a while. These are small victories that lead to big successes in the future when I learn to get through them.<br><br>

<tr>
<td>
<question>What changes did this do to your behavior?</question><br><br>I became more appreciative of and open to ideas, whether from myself or others. I have never been this excited and motivated to act on these projects as soon as I’m able to. I also started to take more risks, like applying for the school radio or making an entire website from scratch for a school project. I never really showed all my talents at an academic setting before, so taking on these things was truly exciting.<br><br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<question>What realizations did you get about the essence of real happiness in engaging with the activity?</question><br><br>Real happiness is being able to see and enjoy the little things, and that sometimes, you have to do something in order to make yourself happy. Also, I shouldn’t really rely on others for my happiness, but when the people you hold close show you love, you have to accept and give that back to them, too, because the best kind of happiness is always one that is shared.<br><br>

<question>What message would you like to tell yourself that will serve as a reminder for you to keep going and hanging on during times when you feel down or the situation in life is more difficult than usual? </question><br><br>One thing I tell myself is that there will be an end to this suffering, so just go and keep going. Additionally, every day is not the same even when it seems like it, for there is always something to look forward to. I just have to try and figure out what that would be.<br><br>
